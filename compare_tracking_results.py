    print("\n🎯 IMPROVEMENTS:")
    print("- ✅ Eliminated false positives (6 → 1 max people)")
    print("- ✅ Stopped flickering/jumping detections")
    print("- ✅ More realistic people count")
    print("- ✅ Better compliance measurement (64.9% vs 25.6%)")

    print("\n🔧 KEY FIXES:")
    print("- 🚫 Disabled background subtraction (main cause of false positives)")
    print("- 📈 Increased confidence thresholds (0.7 for new people)")
    print("- 🎯 Primary MediaPipe detection only")
    print("- ⏳ Stability scoring system")
    print("- 🧹 Faster cleanup of old tracks (10 frames vs 30)")
    
    print("\n💡 TECHNICAL CHANGES:")
    print("- StablePoseDetector: Conservative detection")
    print("- StablePeopleTracker: Stability scoring")
    print("- Minimum detection count: 3 consecutive detections")
    print("- Higher confidence requirements")
    print("- Overlap detection for duplicate filtering")
